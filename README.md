Welcome to this repository, here you will find the code for each project realised during the Web Developper Course I am currently following at Le [Campus Numerique in the Alps](https://le-campus-numerique.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Programme-developpeur-avance.pdf). 

**This repository is the beginning of a portfolio, although not perfect as this point in time.**

Each folder contains a Readme explaining the goal of the project, the features we had to implement, and notes regarding the different features.

> Due to some issues with Github Pages cache, you might sometimes need to hard reload a page (CTRL + Shift + R) if a content isn't properly showing

> OOP hasn't been fully implemented yet into the repository, it is a work in progress.
