Welcome to this repository, here you will find the code for each project realised during the Web Developper Course I am currently following at Le [Campus Numerique in the Alps](https://le-campus-numerique.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Programme-developpeur-avance.pdf). 

The course started on March 13th 2025 for an intensive 9 months, followed by a year of apprenticeship.
This repository is to give you an idea of the projects we have to realize, as well as how I code and to have the beginning of a portfolio, although not perfect as this point in time.
